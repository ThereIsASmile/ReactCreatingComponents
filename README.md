This is a review on React App components!<br>
It is styled with Bulma CSS Library and is responsive from mobile to desktop.<br>
There are 3 components: App.js, ComponentHeader.js and ComponentCard.js.<br>
App.js and Component Card are using props to pass data through the use of variables from the parent (App.js) to the child (ComponentCard.js).<br>
This project was created coding along with Stephen Grider's Modern React with Redux [2023 Update] but content, images, and styling were changed.
