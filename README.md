This is a review on React App components!
It is styled with Bulma CSS Library and is responsive from mobile to desktop.
There are 2 components: ComponentHeader and ComponentCard.
App.js and Component Card are using props to pass data through the use of variables from the parent (App.js) to the child (ComponentCard.js).
